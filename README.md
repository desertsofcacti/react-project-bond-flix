# ReactJS Netflix Clone

This is a ReactJS project that I created while attending a Frontend Masters Course with Brian Holt. Recently I wanted to add some features to the application, but to my dismay, the build had broken several years ago and everytime I would get excited to work on some new feature, fixing the build did not sound fun and I felt discouraged. Recently, I committed to fix the build and I set out to do so. Since then the build is fixed and I made a decision to update to Waku. I will write about my experience, but what I learned about fixing the build was not anything new that I have not already encountered professionally. That said, I selected Waku for its minimal developer-friendly approach to stabilizing the build and improving the developer experience.
